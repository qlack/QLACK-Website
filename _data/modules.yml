  - liquibase:
    title: liquibase
    description:  This tool tries to provide solutions to some usual development use cases pertaining to the evolution of your database schema in your project.
                  The first thing it does is allowing you to produce an initial Liquibase changeset capturing the current state of your schema. 
                  This should be, usually, used in the beginning of your project once you have prepared the initial version of your schema.
                  The second thing it does is producing liquibase changesets capturing changes on the above schema. 
                  This allows you to keep changing your schema using the tools you know rather than having to perform all changes via manually-crafted Liquibase changesets.
