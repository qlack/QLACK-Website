    <h5 class="home-description-margin"> QLACK is an ecosystem of software development libraries and
      utilities, targeting Java and Angular developers. Our goal while developing QLACK is not to
      create a framework but to bundle together functionality we often use in projects under a common
      roof.
      <br>
      <br>
      QLACK has a rich history as in one form or another has been in development for more than
      10 years. It initially started as QLACK 1 based on Enterprise Java Beans technology, it
      continued with QLACK 2 based on OSGi, and currently on version 3 is based on Spring Boot.
      <br>
      <br>
      Using QLACK you can accelerate your Spring Boot-based development as a considerable
      amount of boilerplate code is already provided via QLACK's rich modules ecosystem and APIs.
      QLACK also provides additional utility and tools for Angular and SPAs.
      <br>
      <br>
      QLACK is an Open Source project under EUPL.
